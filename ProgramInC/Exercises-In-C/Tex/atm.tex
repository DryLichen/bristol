\nsection{Cash Machine (ATM)}

Some cash dispensers only contain
$\pounds 20$ notes. When a user types in how much money
they'd like to be given, you need to check that the amount requested
can be dispensed exactly using only $\pounds 20$ notes. If not, a choice
of the two closest (one lower, one higher) amounts is presented.

\begin{exercise}
Write a program that inputs a number from the user and then
prompts them for a better choice if it is not correct. For example~:

\begin{terminaloutput}
How much money would you like ? 175
I can give you 160 or 180, try again.
How much money would you like ? 180
OK, dispensing ...
\end{terminaloutput}

or~:

\begin{terminaloutput}
How much money would you like ? 25
I can give you 20 or 40, try again.
How much money would you like ? 45
I can give you 40 or 60, try again.
How much money would you like ? 80
OK, dispensing ...
\end{terminaloutput}

In this assessment you may assume the input from the
user is ``sensible'' i.e.\ is not a negative number etc.
\end{exercise}
