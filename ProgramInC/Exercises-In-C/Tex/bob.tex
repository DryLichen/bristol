\nsection{Planet Bob}

On the planet Bob, everyone's name has three letters.
These names either take the form of consonant-vowel-consonant or
else vowel-consonant-vowel. For the purposes here, vowels are the 
letters \verb^{a,e,i,o,u}^ and consonants are all other letters.
There are two other rules~:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first letter and third letters of the name must always be the same.
\item The name is only `valid' if,
when you sum up the values of the three letters ($a=1, b=2$ etc.),
the sum is prime.
\end{enumerate}

The name ``bob'' is a valid name: it has the form consonant-vowel-consonant,
the first letter and third letters are the same (`b') and  the three letters sum to $19 (2+15+2)$, which is prime.
The name ``aba' is \textbf{not} valid, since the sum of the three
letters is $4 (1+2+1)$ which is \textbf{not} prime.


\begin{exercise}
Write a program that outputs all the valid names and
numbers them. The first few names should look like~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
  1 aca
  2 aka
  3 aqa
  4 bab
  5 bib
  6 bob
  7 cac
  8 cec
  9 ded
 10 did
 11 dod
 12 dud
 13 ece
 14 ege
 15 eme
 16 ese
 17 faf
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}
