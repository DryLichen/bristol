\nsection{Cuckoo Hashing}

\begin{exercise}
Rewrite your associative array described in Exercise~\ref{ex:hahspoly}
using cuckoo hashing instead.
This involves two tables, and a key is guaranteed to be found (if it
has been inserted) in one of its two locations. Different hash functions
must be used for each of the two tables.
If you do the extension, add :\\
\verb^Cuckoo/specific.h^ and \verb^Cuckoo/cuckoo.c^
to your directory structure in \verb^assoc.zip^.
\end{exercise}
