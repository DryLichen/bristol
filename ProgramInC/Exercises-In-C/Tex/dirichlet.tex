\nsection{Dirichlet Distribution}

When you first start thinking about prime numbers, it becomes pretty
obvious that most of them end with the digit $1,3,7$ or $9$ (they
can't end with two, because they can't be even etc.)
\begin{exercise}
Write a program that computes what fraction of all primes end with a $3$.
You can do this by generating a large number of primes, in sequence, and
keeping a running count of the number that end with $3$, as compared to
the total of primes generated.
\end{exercise}
