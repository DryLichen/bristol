\nsection{Faster MVMs}
The ADT for MVMs used in Exercise~\ref{ex:mvm} is a simple linked list -
insertion is fast, but searching is slow.

\begin{exercise}
Write a new version of this MVM ADT called \verb^fmvm.c^ that
implements exactly the same functionality but has a faster search time.
The file \verb^fmvm.h^ will change very little from \verb^mvm.h^, with maybe
only the structures changing, but not the function prototypes.  A similar
testing file to that used previously, now called \verb^testfmvm.c^
should also be written.  Note that any ordering of data when using
the \verb^mvm_print^ and \verb^mvm_multisearch^ functions is acceptable,
so these can't be tested in exactly the same manner.

By simply changing the \verb^#include^ from \verb^<mvm.h>^ to \verb^<fmvm.h>^
in your \verb^homephones.c^ file from Exercise~\ref{ex:rhymes}, and compiling it against
\verb^fmvm.c^, I can test that program works identically.

Make it clear what you have done to speed up your searching (and how)
using comments at the top of \verb^fmvm.h^

Submit : \verb^fmvm.c^, \verb^fmvm.h^ and \verb^testfmvm.c^
\end{exercise}
