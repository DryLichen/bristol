\nsection{Fibonacci Words using Strings}

\newexercise{2022}

See Section~\ref{sec:fibword_phi}.

\begin{exercise}
Write the function:
\begin{codesnippet}
bool fibword_str(int n)
\end{codesnippet}
which returns to $n^{th}$-digit of the sequence (which begins at $n=1$)
using strings. Previous strings
$S_{k-1}$ and $S_{k-2}$
are repeatedly concatenated to create the new $S_k$, until you have a sequence
large enough to extract the $n^{th}$-digit. 

To achieve this, use fixed-size strings that are set to always be large enough.
\end{exercise}
