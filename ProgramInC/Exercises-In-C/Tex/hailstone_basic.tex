\nsection{Hailstone}
The next number in a hailstone sequence is $n/2$ if the current
number $n$ is even, or $3n+1$ if the current number is odd.

So, for instance, if the initial number is $77$,
then the following sequence is produced:
\begin{terminaloutput}
77
232
116
58
29
88
44
22
11
34
\end{terminaloutput}

\begin{exercise}
Write a program that, given a number typed by the user,
prints out the sequence of {\em hailstone} numbers.
The sequence terminates when it gets to $1$.
\end{exercise}
