\section*{Submitting Your Work}
As you complete each part, submit it online using the Blackboard
submission system. Do not submit files that don't work.

For multi-part questions, if you complete Part~1, submit a file called \verb^part1.c^.\\
If you complete Part~2, submit a file called \verb^part2.c^ and so on.

No partial marks are available.
The only possible scores for each sub-part are pass (100\%) or fail (0\%).
