\nsection{Indexed Arrays}
In the usual places are the files \verb^arr.h^, \verb^arr.c^, \verb^testarr.c^
and a makefile. These files enable you to build, and test, the
ADT for a 1D Indexed Array. This simple replacement for C arrays is
`safe' in the sense that if you write the array out-of-bounds, it
will be automatically resized correctly (using \verb^realloc()^). The
interface to this ADT is in \verb^arr.h^ and its implementation will be in \verb^Realloc/realloc.c^
Typing \verb^make^, compiles these files together with the test
file \verb^testarr.c^. Executing \verb^./testarr^ should result in all
tests passing correctly.

\begin{terminaloutput}
% make run
Basic Array Tests ... Start

\begin{exercise}
\label{ex:indarray}
Write \verb^Realloc/realloc.c^ so that the functionality in the driver code \verb^testarr.c^ is implemented.
\end{exercise}
