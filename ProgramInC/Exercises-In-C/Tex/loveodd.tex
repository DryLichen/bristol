\nsection{Loving Oddness}
Suppose that you hate even integers but love odd ones.

\begin{exercise}
Modify the program you wrote for Exercise~\ref{ex:findmax} so that all variables
are of type \verb^int^, even numbers are ignored and only odd integers are processed.
Explain all this to the user via appropriate \verb^printf()^ statements.
\end{exercise}
