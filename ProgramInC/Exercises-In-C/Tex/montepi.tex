a square whose sides are of length $r$, and a quarter-circle, whose radius is of $r$ are drawn.


If you throw random darts at the square, then many, but not all, also hit the circle. A dart landing at position $(x,y)$ only hits the circle if $x^2 + y^2 \leq r^2$.

The area of the circle is $\frac{\pi}{4} r^2$, and the area of the square is $r^2$.

Therefore, a way to approximate $\pi$, is to choose random $(x,y)$ pairs inside the square $h_a$, and count the $h_c$ ones that hit the circle. Then:
\begin{equation}
	\pi \approx \frac{4 h_c}{h_a}
\end{equation}

Write a program to run this simulation, and display the improving version of the approximation to $\pi$.
