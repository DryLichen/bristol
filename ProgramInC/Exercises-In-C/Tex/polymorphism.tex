\nsection{Towards Polymorphism}

Polymorphism is the concept of writing functions (or ADTs), without
needing to specify which particular type is being used/stored. To
understand the quicksort algorithm, for instance, doesn't really require
you to know whether you're using integers, doubles or some other type. C
is not very good at dealing with polymorphism - you'd need something
like Python, Java or C++ for that. However, it does allow the use of
\verb^void*^ pointers for us to approximate it.

\begin{exercise}
Extend the array ADT discussed in
Exercise~\ref{ex:indarray}, so that any type can be used - files
\verb^varr.h^ and \verb^testvarr.c^ are available in the usual place -
use the Makefile used there, simply swapping \verb^arr^ for \verb^varr^
at the top.
\end{exercise}
