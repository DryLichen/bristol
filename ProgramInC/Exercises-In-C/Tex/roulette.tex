This is an chance for you to practice self-document techniques such as
sensible identifier naming, commenting, \verb^typedefs^ and enumeration.
\begin{exercise}
Write a roulette program. The roulette machine will select
a number between $0$ and $35$ at random. The player
can place an odd/even bet, or a bet on a particular number.
A winning odd/even bet is paid off at $2$ to $1$, except
that all odd/even bets lose if the roulette selects $0$.
If the player places a bet on a particular number, and the
roulette selects it, the player is paid off at $35$ to $1$.
\end{exercise}
