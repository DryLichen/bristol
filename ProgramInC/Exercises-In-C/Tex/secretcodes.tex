\nsection{Secret Codes}

Write a program that converts a stream of text typed by the user
into a `secret' code.
This is achieved by turning every letter 'a' into a 'z', every letter 'b'
into a 'y', every letter 'c' into and 'x' and so on.

\begin{exercise}
Write a function whose `top-line' is~:

\begin{codesnippet}
int scode(int a)
\end{codesnippet}

that takes a character, and returns the secret code for this character.
Note that the function {\bf does} need to preserve the case of the letter,
and that non-letters are returned unaffected. 

When the program is run, the following input:
\begin{terminaloutput}
The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog !
\end{terminaloutput}
produces the following output~:
\begin{terminaloutput}
Gsv Jfrxp Yildm Ulc Qfnkh Levi gsv Ozab Wlt !
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}
