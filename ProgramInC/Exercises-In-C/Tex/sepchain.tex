\nsection{Separate Chaining}
Separate chaining deals with collisions by forming (hopefully small) linked lists
out from a base array.
\begin{exercise}
Adapt Exercise~\ref{ex:dblhash} so that:
\begin{itemize}
\item A linked-list style approach is used.
\item No assumptions about the maximum size of the dictionary file is made.
\item The same hash function as before is used.
\item Once the hash table is built, reads another list of words from \verb^argv[2]^
and reports on the {\em average} number of  look-ups required. A {\em perfect} hash
will require exactly $1.0$ look-up, on average. Assuming the program works correctly,
this number is the only output required from the program.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}
