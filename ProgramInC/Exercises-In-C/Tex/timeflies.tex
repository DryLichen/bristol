\nsection{Time Flies}
\begin{exercise}
Write a program which allows the user to enter two times in
24-hour clock format, and computes the length of time between the
two, e.g.:
\begin{terminaloutput}
Enter two times : 23:00 04:15
Difference is : 5:15
\end{terminaloutput}
or,
\begin{terminaloutput}
Enter two times : 23:40 22:50
Difference is : 23:10
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}
