\nsection{Turtle Graphics}

\subsection*{History}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many attempts have been made to create programming languages
which are intuitive and easy to learn.
\item One of the best of these was {\it LOGO} which allowed
children as young as 3 to learn a computer language.
\item A subset of this language involved a ``turtle'' which
could be driven around the screen using simple instructions.
The turtle, when viewed from above, was represented by a triangle.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Adding Loops}
\begin{codesnippet}
{
   DO A FROM 1 TO 8 {
      FD 30
      LT 45
   }
}
\end{codesnippet}

\subsection*{Using Variables}
\begin{codesnippet}
{
   DO A FROM 1 TO 100 {
      SET C := A 1.5 * ;
      FD C
      RT 62
   }
}
\end{codesnippet}

\end{center}

\subsection*{Nested Loops}
\begin{codesnippet}
{
   DO A FROM 1 TO 50 {
      FD A
      RT 30
      DO B FROM 1 TO 8 {
         SET C := A 5 / ;
         FD C
         RT 45
      }
   }
}
\end{codesnippet}
