\nsection{Twice the Sum}
Here is part of a program that begins by asking the user to input three
integers:
\begin{codesnippet}
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
   int a, b, c;

   printf("Input three integers: ");
\end{codesnippet}
$\ldots$\\

\begin{exercise}
Complete the program so that when the user executes it and types in 2, 3,
and 7, this is what appears on the screen:
\begin{terminaloutput}
Input three integers: 2 3 7
Twice the sum of integers plus 7 is 31 !
\end{terminaloutput}
\end{exercise}
