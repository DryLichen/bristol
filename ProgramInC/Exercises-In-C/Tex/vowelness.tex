\nsection{Vowelness}
Vowels are the letters $a$, $e$, $i$, $o$ and $u$.
\begin{exercise}
Write a program that reads characters from the keyboard and writes to the
screen. Write all vowels as uppercase letters, and all non-vowels as
lowercase letters. Do this by using writing a function \verb^isvowel()^
that tests whether or not a character is a vowel.
