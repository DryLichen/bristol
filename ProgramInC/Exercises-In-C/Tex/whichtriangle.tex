\nsection{Triangles}

A triangle can be equilateral (all three sides have the same length),
isosceles (has two equal length sides), scalene
(all the sides have a different length), or
right angled where if the three sides are $a$, $b$ and $c$,
and $c$ is the longest, then~:
\begin{math}
c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
\end{math}

\begin{exercise}
Write a program so that you can process a number of triples of side lengths
in a single run of your program using a suitable
unlikely input value for the first integer in order to terminate
the program. e.g. -999.

Think hard about the test data for your program to ensure that
all possible cases are covered and all invalid data results in
a sensible error message. Such cases can include sides of negative length,
and impossible triangles (e.g. one side is longer than the sum of the other two).
