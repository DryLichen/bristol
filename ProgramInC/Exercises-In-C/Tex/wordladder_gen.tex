In this game, made famous by the author Lewis Caroll, and investigated by many Computer Scientists including Donald Knuth,
you find missing words to complete a sequence.
For instance, you might be asked how go from ``WILD'' to ``TAME''
by only changing one character at a time:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\matrix (wild2tame) [matrix of nodes]
{
W&I&L&D \\
W&I&L&E \\
T&I&L&E \\
T&A&L&E \\
T&A&M&E \\
};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
